    &nbsp;
    Getting Started
</h2>

<p>To get started in DSC 190, you'll need to set up accounts on a couple of
websites.</p>
<h4 id="campuswire">Campuswire</h4>
<p>We'll be using <a href="https://campuswire.com/c/G9B54D5CE/feed">Campuswire</a>
as our course message board. Campuswire is like
Piazza, but unlike Piazza, Campuswire does not sell student data to third
parties. You should have received an invitation via email, but if not you should get in
touch with a course staff member as soon as possible, as we'll be making all
course announcements via Campuswire.</p>
<p>If you have a question about anything to do with the course  &mdash; if you're stuck on a
homework problem, want clarification on the logistics, or just have a general question
about data science &mdash; you can make a post on Campuswire. We only ask that if your
question includes some or all of an answer, please make your post <strong>private</strong> so that
others cannot see it. You can also post anonymously if you would prefer.</p>
<p>Course staff will regularly check Campuswire and try to answer any questions that you
have. You're also encouraged to answer a question asked by another student if you
feel that you know the answer.</p>
<h4 id="gradescope">Gradescope</h4>
<p>We'll be using 
<a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/220719">Gradescope</a> for
homework submission and grading. Most of the assignments will be a mixture of math and
coding, and the coding parts are usually autograded via Gradescope.,
You should have received an email invitation for Gradescope, but if not please
let us know as soon as possible (preferably via Campuswire).</p>
<h4 id="zoom">Zoom</h4>
<p>Some aspects of the course, like office hours and the remote discussion, will be held using
Zoom. You should already have an account through UCSD; see the <a href="https://edtech.ucsd.edu/education-continuity-tools-and-resources/zoom-guides.html">Zoom
guide</a>
for more help. Note that you will <strong>not</strong> be expected to have a webcam!</p>
<h4 id="canvas">Canvas</h4>
<p>We'll use <a href="canvas.ucsd.edu">Canvas</a> for the course gradebook and for the exams.</p>
<h4 id="required-materials">Required Materials</h4>
<p>No materials are required for this course; we'll use online video lectures as
the main resource. Furthermore, since this class builds off of DSC 40B you might find
the <a href="https://eldridgejm.github.io/dsc40b-2021-wi-public/published/default/notes/book.pdf">DSC 40B course
notes</a> to be helpful.</p>
<p>That said, here are some books that you might find useful.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein; <em>Introduction to Algorithms</em></li>
<li>Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, Vazirani; <em>Algorithms</em></li>
</ul>
<p>You will <strong>not</strong> need a webcam, but you'll need a way to access the internet and
to upload pictures of your homework. If you foresee this being problematic
&mdash; or you find that you're unable to fully participate in the class for any
reason &mdash; send us a message on Campuswire and
we'll figure it out.</p>
<h2 id="lectures">
<i class="em em-male-teacher" aria-role="presentation" aria-label=""></i>
&nbsp;
Lectures
</h2>

<p>DSC 190 is entirely online this quarter due to the <i class="em em-microbe"
aria-role="presentation" aria-label="MICROBE"></i>. As such, all lectures will be
pre-recorded YouTube videos. Links to these videos will be posted before the
regularly-scheduled lecture time on Tuesdays and Thursdays. You will be able
to watch them whenever is most convenient for you.  </p>
<p>The downside of pre-recorded lectures, of course, is that there is no possibility for
interaction. To help mitigate this, I will be holding office hours on Tuesday and
Thursday. If you watch the lecture during this hour and have a question, feel
free to stop by office hours for a quick answer.</p>
<h2 id="discussions">
<i class="em em-raised_hand_with_fingers_splayed" aria-role="presentation" aria-label=""></i>
&nbsp;
Discussions
</h2>

<p>We will have weekly, hour-long live Zoom <strong>discussion</strong> sections led by the TA and focused on
solving problems.  Discussion is held on Thursday at 1:00 pm via Zoom.
The Zoom meeting link for the discussion will be available on the front page of the
course website, and a discussion worksheet will be posted beforehand.</p>
<p>The discussions review the materials from that week's lectures and
prepare you for the homework. Just as with lecture, topics and techniques introduced
in discussion might appear on the homework and in exams. In particular, some of the more
difficult homework problems may be partially solved in discussion section to give you a
good start. </p>
<p>Virtual attendance in discussion section is recommended, but not required.
We'll record the discussion and post the link on the front page of the course
site.</p>
<h2 id="office-hours">
<i class="em em-hourglass_flowing_sand" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="HOURGLASS WITH FLOWING SAND"></i>
&nbsp;
Office Hours
</h2>

<p>We will hold office hours regularly throughout the week. This quarter, all office hours
will be via Zoom.  Please see the <a href="./office_hours.html">office hours</a> page for the
schedule and for instructions.</p>
<h2 id="homeworks">
<i class="em em-house_with_garden" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="HOUSE WITH GARDEN"></i>
&nbsp;
Homeworks
</h2>

<p>There will be eight homeworks assigned throughout the quarter
Homeworks will be a mixture of written problems (which are manually graded by our tutor
staff) and coding problems (which are autograded).
Each homework will be due via
Gradescope at 11:59 PM on the Thursday after it is assigned except otherwise
noted, and you'll have roughly a week to complete each assignment from the time it is
posted. The lowest homework will be dropped.</p>
<p>The homework due date is carefully chosen to fit within a one week "cycle". On Tuesdays
and Thursdays, you'll have lecture. That week's discussion will review the lecture
topics with an eye towards practical application. The homework is then due the
<em>following</em> week, giving you several days after the discussion to complete it.</p>
<h4 id="slip-days">Slip Days</h4>
<p>You have four <strong>slip days</strong> to use throughout the quarter. A slip day extends the
deadline of any one homework by 24 hours. Slip days cannot be "stacked" or "combined" to
extend the deadline further &mdash;
the latest any one homework can be submitted is 24 hours after the deadline.
Slip days are applied automatically at the end of the quarter, but it's your
responsibility to keep track of how many you have left.</p>
<p>Slip days are designed to be a transparent and predictable source of leniency in
deadlines. You can use a slip day if you are too busy to complete an assignment on its
original due date (or if you forgot about it). But slips days are also meant for things
like the internet going down at 11:58 PM just as you go to submit your homework. Slip
days are to be used in exceptional circumstances, so you probably shouldn't get
close to using all four â if you feel that you will need that many, send me a message and we'll figure something out.</p>
<h4 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h4>
<p>You are highly encouraged to <em>think</em> about the homework problems together, but you must
turn in your own solutions written in your own words. We feel that discussing homework
problems is an excellent way to learn, but writing the solutions in your own words
promotes a deeper, more solid understanding than discussion alone.</p>
<p>We recommend the following way of working on the homeworks. First, meet with your
partner to discuss the solutions, but don't leave the meeting with anything written
down. Wait an hour or so, then write up the solutions in your own words working from
memory. In that hour, you inevitably forgot some of the details of the solution. If you
find that you have trouble filling them in, its a sign that you might not have
understood the solution as well as you first thought!</p>
<p>If you have any questions or worries about whether your collaboration constitutes
a violation of academic integrity, feel free to ask us on Campuswire.</p>
<h4 id="regrade-requests">Regrade Requests</h4>
<p>If you feel that the grader has made a mistake, you may submit a regrade request
via Gradescope within <strong>one week</strong> of the grades being released. Note that part
of your grade is clarity, so if your answer was mostly right but unclear you may
still not deserve full credit.</p>
<h2 id="exams">
<i class="em em-writing_hand" aria-role="presentation" aria-label=""></i>
&nbsp;
Exams
</h2>

<p>There will be one final exam in this course. It will be in the format of a "take-home
exam", and will be due during finals week. You can think of the final exam as a
comprehensive homework that reviews all of the quarter's material. It will be released
ahead of time, so you'll have several days to complete the exam.</p>
<h2 id="grading">
<i class="em em-100" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="HUNDRED POINTS SYMBOL"></i>
&nbsp;
Grading Scheme
</h2>

<p>We'll be using the following grading scheme:</p>
<ul>
<li>70%: Homeworks (lowest dropped)</li>
<li>30%: Take-Home Final Exam</li>
</ul>
<p>The standard grading scale (where an A is 93+, A- is 90+, B+ is 87+, etc.) will be used
as a starting point, but once all scores are in, I will run a clustering algorithm to
automatically find the best cutoffs for each letter grade. These cutoffs can only be
lowered. For instance, the threshold for an "A" will never be higher than 93%.</p>
<h2 id="illness">
<i class="em em-mask" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK"></i>
&nbsp;
Illnesses and Extenuating Circumstances
</h2>

<p>Because of the pandemic, we must prepare for the unfortunate possibility that
you will get sick and be unable to participate in this class for long periods of
time.  The university has a mechanism for helping in this situation: the
<strong>Incomplete</strong>. If you are unable to complete the course because of reasons
outside of your control, you may be given an Incomplete instead of a letter grade. This
simply means that you will complete the rest of the work at a later time. Once you have
done so, your overall grade is calculated and your Incomplete grade is replaced.</p>
<div class="alert alert-danger"> 
An Incomplete does not allow you to re-do work that has already been completed,
only to do work that hasn't been completed.
</div>

<p>Unfortunately, your personal health is not the only thing that might prevent
you from participating in this class. Some of us will get sick, others will have
family members fall ill, and others might lose their jobs. If you have
any doubt about your ability to perform satisfactorily in this course due to
something outside of your control, <strong>please contact us ASAP</strong> and we'll figure
something out.</p>

Frequently Asked Questions
</h2>

<h4 id="will-more-seats-be-added-what-are-my-chances-of-getting-off-of-the-wait-list">Will more seats be added / what are my chances of getting off of the wait list?</h4>
<p>This being the first offering of this course, we decided to keep the enrollment size
small. Unfortunately, this also means that we have only one TA and no tutors for a class
that has a heavy grading load. As such, we probably won't be increasing the size of the
class.</p>
<h4 id="do-i-need-a-webcam-for-this-class">Do I need a webcam for this class?</h4>
<p>Nope! If you have one, you're welcome to use it; it can be especially useful to
share your work during office hours. But we won't require webcams. In
particular, we are <strong>not</strong> using proctoring services like examity.</p>
<h4 id="what-happens-if-the-professor-gets-sick-and-cant-run-the-course">What happens if the professor gets sick and can't run the course?</h4>
<p>We've prepared for this possibility in a couple of ways. Namely:</p>
<ol>
<li>"Backup" faculty have been selected who are ready to take over the course.</li>
<li>All grades will be stored in Canvas/Gradescope so that they are accessible to the
   university.</li>
</ol>
